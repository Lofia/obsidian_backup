- Hi Dr. Sun, the attached contains 1. an example of saved matrix of simulation result, under the setting that training X~N(0,1), Y=2X+N(0,0.8); testing X~N(5,1), Y=2X+ N(0,0.8) (the setting displayed in part 4 of the Word file). And the matrix has 3 columns, 'rmse_lm' (the RMSE of traditional method),'rmse_lm_mm' (the RMSE of our approach), and 'diff' (rmse_lm-rmse_lm_mm). You can use download the code and use "load("cov_shift_toy.RData")" to read the matrix. 2. the update version of brief results, where I a. added package reference link for traditional method. b. added red vertical line for the histogram. extended the illustration for our method, made it cl
