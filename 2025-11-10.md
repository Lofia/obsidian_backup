- 

### In Meeting
- 

### After
- consider connection between data shifts / selection bias, generate a case of data to show our monotone case is more general than parametric cases (prior-prob shift and covariate shift): how our method works on bi-variate case? and even their shifts modes? are we doing tests? comparing powers?
