### Before
- 

### In Meeting
- presented R packages ([https://bartonicek.github.io/plotscaper/](https://bartonicek.github.io/plotscaper/ "https://bartonicek.github.io/plotscaper/") and [https://github.com/posit-dev/querychat?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/posit-dev/querychat?tab=readme-ov-file "https://github.com/posit-dev/querychat?tab=readme-ov-file")) and synthetic data paper

### After
- go into detail again for synthetic data
	- I'm interested in what model did they use in the paper, what result they could convey, and what restrictions were there. Can you please explain those in the language of statistics?
	- What can statistician learn from this paper? What conclusion can be incorporated by statisticians, especially for me that studies methods of detecting monotone selection bias?
	- I'm going to give a presentation on the paper to a bunch of statisticians, who only the preliminary knowledge of neural networks (they know the methods like normalizing flows, but they've never coded any real project with neural networks). What shall I focus on? How shall I explain the models, methods, and results to the audience efficiently?
