Method: Mary's spline
Theory: theta
Simulation: Poisson / Binom for NPMLE ... 
	Use what to estimate theta for K-S and A-D? / using 95% for AD may not be appropriate
Application: z affect? / why estimated differently? / quantitative analysis
Coding: Algorithm to tune the parameters for the R package
