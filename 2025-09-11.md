### Before
- General Idea for the Synthetic Data Paper:
- The paper treats the generator as producing i.i.d. synthetic draws $\widetilde Z_1,\dots,\widetilde Z_m\sim\tilde F$ which are then combined with (or replace) the real sample $Z_1,\dots,Z_n$ for constructing estimators/predictors.
- Let $\hat\theta(\widetilde Z_m)$ be an estimator trained on $m$ synthetic samples from $\tilde F$. The paper gives bounds of the form
$$
\mathcal{R}\big(\hat\theta(\widetilde Z_m)\big)
\le \underbrace{\mathcal{R}^\star}_{\text{ideal-data risk}} \;+\; C_1\cdot m\cdot d(\tilde F, F)\;+\; C_2\cdot \varepsilon_{\text{stat}}(m,n),
$$
where $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a distributional distance (TV or Wasserstein), $C_1,C_2$ are constants depending on the loss/learner, and $\varepsilon_{\text{stat}}(m,n)$ are sampling / estimation terms that shrink with $m$ (e.g. $\propto m^{-1/2}$ up to logs).

- $\textit{detail with Differential Privacy}$

### In Meeting
- Looked into synthetic data paper

### After
- looked into concrete example of the paper: how to generate data, what is the inference model, how much did the synthetic data help?
