### Before
- this week, spent a lot of time preparing for teaching
- 

### In Meeting
- paragraph for where we are:
	- MM & MM+NPMLE method: verifying proof and putting things into the paper draft
	- possible future topic: apply transfer learning:
		- f0(x,y)=f(y|x)g(x), f1(x,y)=f(y|x)g(x)pi(y)/Kappa
		- Ei(Y|X)=eta_i(x)=... (based on f0, f1)
		- assume: gamma(eta_1(x))=gamma(eta_0(x))+phi(x)theta

### After
- reply to Nathan
