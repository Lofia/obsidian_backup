### Before
- changed the bi-variate tggd case into single-variate, since the scale should always be 1

### In Meeting
- 

### After
- verify how the BH adjustment was done by `p.adjust()`
- contact Wei
- no MLE for tggd, even wrong derivation when transforming into gamma
- leave the astronomy data, use previous (test 1) data  _[Meisner, J. and Demirmen F. (1981)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2982158?seq=1 "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2982158?seq=1")_
