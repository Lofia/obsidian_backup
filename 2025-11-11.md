### Before
- 

### In Meeting
- respond to Letitia's paper's revision comments

### After
- move test 2 to annals' format, add simulation (use MM to estimate theta (nice estimates), and apply test2, and compare with KS-test (use the same $n^{-1/2}$ level estimator of theta, or just use the same )) and additional things (condition that theta converges in $n^{-1/2}$ rate)
