### Before
- 

### In Meeting
- Discussed with Nathan:
	- Blanton paper focused on around $z=0.1$
	- for $\alpha < -1$, we may need a cut off at probably $L^*$?
	- may need to combine the information / estimation of L for low z and high z, since for low $z$ ($d$), typically we have lower luminosity galaxies
	- depending on $z$, model can be different, e.g., for $z < 0.5$, d is proportional to $c\cdot z/H_0$
	- re-look at the simulation from the Jupiter notebook, apply our methods to it
	- use the best-fit parameters estimated from the Blanton paper, to simulate luminosities of galaxies, and apply our method, see what figure we get and if it's different from the figure in the plot
- 

### After
- write a paragraph of design of simulation / comparison to Nathan / Dr. Sun]
- Sanity check

- anyway to do scaling? for the case that rate < n-1/2 in test2
