### Before
- 

### In Meeting
- Discussed with Nathan:
	- lantern paper focused on around $z=0.1$
	- for $\alpha < -1$, we may need a cut off at probably $L^*$?
	- may need to combine the information / estimation of L for low z and high z, since for low $z$ ($d$), typically we have lower luminosity galaxies
	- depending on $z$, model can be different, e.g., for $z < 0.5$, d is proportional to $c\cdot z/H_0$
	- re-look at the simulation from the Jupiter notebook, apply our methods to it
