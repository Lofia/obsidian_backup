- 

### In Meeting
- talked about our experiences in JSM
- volunteer, nominate, write proposals, publish, follow-up, communicate

### After
- ≤ in page 19 of test2]
- remind: check Nathan
- remind: letter of support to Hunter
- last corollary / Brownian bridge?
- assumption for theta:
	- estimating v even contaminates the rate of theta (ChatGPT result) → under iterative estimation with mixed data, we need n/m→0 (however, contradicted by simulation **!!!**) → But this is worse than estimating theta independently using m unbiased data. 
- verify limiting distribution: use unbiased data to estimate theta (or even use true theta, 1999 case), see if the distribution of Lambda matches our result
	- test 1 is fine, but why is there a W?
	- test 2 failed, the simulated results looked like test 1, but theoretical results differ (due to no W?)
- Went through Mary's spline: ...
- Prepared for group meeting slide: synthetic data
