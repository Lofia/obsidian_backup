### Before
- 

### In Meeting
- talked about our experiences in JSM
- volunteer, nominate, write proposals, publish, follow-up, communicate

### After
- <= in page 19 of test2
- remind: check Nathan
- remind: letter of support to Hunter
- last corollary / brownian bridge?
- assumption for theta:
	- estimating v even contaminates the rate of theta (ChaGPT result) -> under iterative estimation with mixed data, we need n/m->0 (verified by simulation???) -> But this is worse than estimating theta independently using m unbiased data. 
- verify limiting distribution: use unbiased data to estimate theta (or even use true theta, 1999 case), see if the distribution of Lambda matches our result???
