### Before
- 

### In Meeting
- talked about our experiences in JSM
- volunteer, nominate, write proposals, publish, follow-up, communicate

### After
- last corollary / brownian bridge?
- assumption for theta:
	- estimating v even contaminates the rate of theta (ChaGPT result) -> under iterative estimation with mixed data, we need n/m->0 (verified by simulation???) -> But this is worse than estimating theta independently using m unbiased data.
