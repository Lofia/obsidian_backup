### Before
- 

### In Meeting
- 

### After
- check proof: if unstable convergence rate of theta would affect the proof? - seems to be fine if proof of lemma 4.1 (test2) works
- on the other hand, simulation show convergence when m=n at least while the dimension of theta < 3
- also, the convergence rate of gamma_n (line 5, p16, test2)
