### After
- Compare with the shape of fig 5 of  https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/375776/pdf (be careful of r):
	- still, use previous estimates of L
	- generate random numbers from the corrected estimation of L
	- convert back to M
	- plot, with original M, k-corrected M
	- (try for z around 0.01 first, then think about combining all z?)
